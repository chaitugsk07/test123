      "[\"Chandrayaan 3: ISRO releases 3D pictures of the Moon's surface and we are wonderstruck!\", \"The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) recently announced that its Vikram Lander has been put into sleep mode. However, what's even more exciting are the images it has captured. As Chandrayaan 3 marks the first mission on the southern lunar surface, people on the internet have been eagerly requesting more images of the moon's surface. ISRO has been periodically releasing these pictures, but now they've accomplished something unique. Just one day after ISRO revealed that Vikram Lander had been powered down and put to sleep, the space agency tweeted images of the lunar surface in 3D. To get the best view of these images, viewers are recommended to wear 3D glasses.\", 'ISRO has shared a 3D \\'anaglyph\\' image of Chandrayaan 3\\'s Vikram lander from the South Pole of the moon. This image looks quite unusual because the left channel displays the red channel, while the right one shows the green and blue channels. This combination results in some visually striking features. ISRO\\'s Twitter account posted the 3D moon picture, explaining that it was created using both left and right images captured through the NavCam Stereo on board. \"The Anaglyph presented here is created using NavCam Stereo Images, which consist of both a left and right image captured onboard the Pragyan Rover,\" said ISRO.', 'An anaglyph is a 3D representation of an object that is shown in three colours: red, blue, and green, from multiple viewpoints. In this 3D image, the left image is placed in the red channel, while the right one goes into the blue and green channels, giving it a cyan appearance. The differences in perspective create a stereo effect, providing a visual impression of three dimensions. To view these images properly, it is recommended to use red and cyan glasses.', 'These images were released after ISRO announced that Vikram Lander had been put to sleep on the morning of September 4th, around 8 a.m. IST. ISRO explained that once the data collected by the payloads is transmitted to Earth and their tasks are completed, they are turned off. It is anticipated that Vikram Lander and Pragyaan will be awakened again around September 22.', \"With the success of Chandrayaan 3, India has become the fourth country in the world to successfully land on the moon, bringing relief after the challenges faced during Chandrayaan 2's mission.\"]\n"

They told the judge that Dial thought Irizarry had a gun. The bodycam footage shows the driver holding a knife by his right leg.</p> <p>Testimony from Dial's partner, Officer Michael Morris, at Tuesday's preliminary hearing corroborated statements made by authorities. He said the pair had been following Irizarry, who was driving erratically, turned the wrong way down a one-way street and stopped. Morris said Irizarry had a knife in his hand and started to raise it as the officers approached.</p> <p>\\\"I screamed that he had a knife,\\\" said Morris, adding the knife had a black metal handle that could have been mistaken for a gun, The Associated Press reported.</p> <p>An emotional Dial was seen sitting at the defense table while prosecutors played footage of the fatal shooting captured by Morris' body camera. The prosecution said the videos were \\\"crucial evidence in the case\\\" and said they \\\"speak for themselves.\\\"\\u00a0</p> <p>Irizarry\\u2019s family has said that Dial deserves a long prison sentence.</p> <p>Dial, 27, is a five-year member of the Philadelphia Police Department.

Roy Cooper</a> announced on Monday after achieving what he's sought for nearly seven years on the job and what's possibly his biggest policy win.</p> <p>Government health insurance should be available to another 600,000 low-income adults, with roughly half of them receiving coverage on Day One. But securing expansion through the Republican-controlled state legislature came with hefty political expenses for the Democratic governor that will be difficult to reverse.</p> <p>Still, Cooper celebrated the influx of billions of dollars from the federal government that he says will boost rural hospitals, create jobs and help those suffering with pain and illness that they can't otherwise afford to treat because they are uninsured.</p> <p><a href=\\\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/medicaid-expansion-may-enacted-north-carolina-pending-approval-final-budget\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><strong>MEDICAID EXPANSION MAY BE ENACTED IN NORTH CAROLINA, PENDING APPROVAL OF FINAL BUDGET</strong></a></p> <p>\\\"This has been an unnecessarily long and agonizing journey for many North Carolinians,\\\" Cooper said at an Executive Mansion news conference with health Secretary Kody Kinsley to reveal the start date. \\\"But today, the hope that has stirred in so many across our state will become a reality.\\\"</p> <p>Cooper said he and Kinsley have talked to federal officials and that a potential government shutdown in Washington shouldn\\u2019t delay the Dec. 1 start date.</p> <p>A landmark bipartisan <a href=\\\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/health-care\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Medicaid law</a> that Cooper signed in March removed North Carolina from the list of 11 states that at the time hadn\\u2019t accepted expansion. The law required a budget to be approved before expansion could be implemented.</p> <p>Republicans with narrow veto-proof control of the General Assembly piled provisions inside that spending plan, unveiled last week, which weaken Cooper and future governors to the benefit of the General Assembly.</p> <p>Cooper also had to stomach other policy prescriptions within the budget bill, such as a massive enlargement of the state's private-school voucher program to all K-12 children regardless of family income.</p> <p>It appeared Republicans had enough support to override any Cooper veto. Rather than signing the budget bill into law, Cooper announced minutes after it received final legislative approval on Friday that he would let the bill become law without his signature. That means the budget should be enacted Oct. 3.</p> <p>\\\"I know there\\u2019s a lot of bad in the budget that they passed,\\\" the governor said, but \\\"in this legislative circus we can\\u2019t take any more chances on delay or defeat with the lives of so many people at stake.\\\"</p> <p>A state budget was supposed to be in place July 1, but it took 2 1/2 more months to finalize as negotiations slowed among Republicans over income tax reductions and the distribution of billions of dollars for capital improvements, economic development and other areas. A stalemate over whether more gambling should be authorized also briefly threatened whether a budget would get approved.</p> <p>The state Department of Health and Human Services had said expansion would've started Oct. 1 had a budget been completed by the end of August.</p> <p><a href=\\\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/north-carolina-medicaid-program-meant-treat-mental-illness-disabilities-delayed-again\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><strong><u>NORTH CAROLINA MEDICAID PROGRAM MEANT TO TREAT THOSE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS, DISABILITIES DELAYED AGAIN</u></strong></a></p> <p>Through expansion, adults age 19-64 get coverage even if they make too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid but too little to receive even heavily subsidized private insurance. For example, a single person who makes up to about $20,000 or someone in a family of three that makes $34,000 would benefit.</p> <p>Nearly 2.9 million people are currently enrolled for Medicaid in <a href=\\\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/north-carolina\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">North Carolina</a>. Kinsley, the health secretary, said roughly 300,000 people who participate in a limited Medicaid program for family planning benefits and who meet income requirements will automatically be registered for full Medicaid benefits.</p> <p>Additional recipients will accumulate as people learn about the expansion and county social service offices enroll them, Kinsley said.</p> <p>To those who'll benefit from expansion, Kinsley said, \\\"I have one final message: We\\u2019ve got you covered.\\\"</p> <p>Within days of taking office in January 2017, Cooper tried to get expansion initiated before the Obama administration ended. But a 2013 law required express approval of the General Assembly before expansion could be sought, and a federal court blocked Cooper's efforts.</p> <p>Cooper vetoed the state budget in 2019 because legislative leaders wouldn\\u2019t commit to Medicaid talks. That led to a protracted impasse and a traditional state budget was never approved that year.</p> <p>\\\"I don\\u2019t regret a single attempt to expand Medicaid because I think it has led us to this day,\\\" Cooper said Monday.</p> <p>By mid-2022 both the House and Senate had passed competing expansion measures.</p> <p>Top Republican leaders said they changed their opinion on expansion because traditional Medicaid was on firmer fiscal ground compared to the early 2010s. They were also attracted to a financial bonus for the state from Congress should North Carolina accept expansion. Hospital leaders, Republican sheriffs and county GOP officials also lobbied them to accept expansion.</p> <p>President Joe Biden acknowledged on Monday the expansion accomplishment in a written statement, praising \\\"bipartisan elected officials\\\" as well as Cooper, whom he cited for \\\"years of leadership fighting to get this monumental step forward for North Carolina families done.\\\"</p>\"\n",

      "            \"value\": \"<p>Lane Bolich first came to work in Alaska for the freedom and excitement that comes with being a fisher.</p> <p>A self-described adrenaline junkie, Bolich moved from his hometown in rural Washington state because he loves being on <a href=\\\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/environment/oceans\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">the ocean</a> even in cold winter weather and it gave him the chance to make more money than back home. After working as a deckhand for two years on a family friend\\u2019s boat, Harmony, he took the wheel as captain this year at just 20 years old.</p> <p>Bolich is a rarity in an aging industry with high barriers to entry \\u2014 equipment and access rights are costly \\u2014 and increasing unpredictability as human-caused climate change alters marine habitats. As some fish populations dwindle and fewer people pursue the trade, fishers and conservation groups are actively working to bring in and retain the next generation of fishers through grants and training even as the industry continues to shrink in Alaska.</p> <p><a href=\\\"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/virginia-fisherman-catches-extremely-rare-blue-mouth-fish-wild-genetic-pigment-mutation\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><strong><u>VIRGINIA FISHERMAN CATCHES 'EXTREMELY RARE' BLUE-MOUTH FISH: 'WILD GENETIC PIGMENT MUTATION'</u></strong></a></p> <p>For the young people who do become commercial fishers, many see it as a way to make good money for a short time, while some others have a desire to sustain the industry for the long term in a way that benefits both fishers and fisheries. But with the obstacles outweighing the perks, young fishers are in short supply.</p> <p>\\\"There's no future for an industry that doesn't have young people coming in,\\\" said Linda Behnken, the executive director of the Alaska Longline Fishermen's Association. \\\"They're thinking about the long term health of the resource, the health of the industry and the <a href=\\\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/great-outdoors/fishing\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">fishing communities</a> that they're a part of.\\\"</p> <p>A 2018 study found the average age of fishers had increased 10 years from the previous generation to about 50 years old. Rural communities also lost 30% of their local permit holders as access rights consolidated and made it harder for new fishers to enter the industry.</p> <p>But the biggest challenge, Behnken said, is climate change and what it means for the long-term health of the fishing stock and the industry. Research has shown that warming ocean temperatures may make fish habitats less suitable, leading to changing populations and different ecosystems, and the potential loss of commercially-important fish species.</p> <p>\\\"I think people recognize the future is less predictable in fisheries, that we\\u2019re going to see bigger fluctuations,\\\" she said. \\\"There\\u2019s just a lot more unknowns.\\\"</p> <p>These challenges are apparent to Bolich. He said working as a commercial fisher today means working to undo the damage to fisheries from harmful practices in the past like overfishing and understanding the impact climate change will have on fish populations.</p> <p>\\\"I think that the golden days of fishing are kind of behind us,\\\" he said. \\\"Now it\\u2019s kind of a recovery of trying to bring the fish back and trying to keep this viable way of making a living.\\\"</p> <p>Marissa Wilson, executive director of the Alaska Marine Conservation Council, noted that the decline in the number of people working coincides with the shrinking of fisheries in general as populations of fish decline and move. The high initial cost of access rights and equipment has also deterred some people from pursuing commercial fishing.</p> <p>\\\"It\\u2019s a handful of things coming into confluence at once that makes it difficult,\\\" she said.</p> <p><a href=\\\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/coast-guard-suspends-search-4-missing-after-alaska-charter-boat-partially-submerged\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><strong><u>COAST GUARD SUSPENDS SEARCH FOR 4 MISSING AFTER ALASKA CHARTER BOAT FOUND PARTIALLY SUBMERGED</u></strong></a></p> <p>The Alaska Marine Conservation Council and the Alaska Longline Fishermen's Association actively lobbied Congress for passage of the Young Fishermen\\u2019s Development Act, which passed in January 2021. As part of that act, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Sea Grant Office awarded about $1 million this year to help fund on-ship training and mentorship for young fishers in Alaska.</p> <p>More training should help as finding reliable crew for boats is difficult, according to Darren Platt, captain of the Agnes Sabine, a salmon fishing boat based in Kodiak. When Platt started running his own boat in 2010, unemployment was high and labor was easier to find, but as jobs have become more available in the lower 48, Platt has noticed fewer people making their way to Kodiak to work. That loss of labor, combined with a lack of experienced career fishers, makes fully staffing a boat a challenge.</p> <p>\\\"We need to continuously bring in people from outside to come up and work,\\\" he said. \\\"And it\\u2019s usually college students or young folks looking for an adventure, but not career fisherman.\\\"</p> <p>For Juan Zuniga, a first-year deckhand on Platt\\u2019s boat, that sense of adventure and the prospect of making good money drew him to Kodiak from his home in Florida. Platt's been teaching Zuniga everything he knows about working on a boat.</p> <p>\\\"This is a pretty far place from where I live so a very big step out of my comfort zone,\\\" Zuniga said. \\\"I still got a lot to learn.\\\"</p> <p>Retaining deckhands is key for Platt and he says he focuses on keeping crew members as comfortable as possible so that they might return again to work the following season.</p> <p>For many though, contract work on a boat is a quick way to make money and gain experience for a different career. Sam Stern, a deckhand on the Big Blue, plans to pursue a career in marine engineering and worked this season to both make money for school and to earn hours at sea for eventual licensing he'll need for that job.</p> <p>\\\"I guess people my age don\\u2019t really think about this as like a career,\\\" Stern said, adding that he can make up to $20,000 in a single summer. \\\"It is more of a way just to make money quickly.\\\"</p> <p>But fishing has become more than that for Bolich.</p> <p>On the Harmony, Bolich is running between the deck and the cabin, grabbing power tools and fixing equipment before heading back out to sea to supply fishing boats and haul their catch back for processing. As captain, he has to know every aspect of every job and be able lead a crew older than himself. He admits his first year will be a learning experience, but he isn't deterred.</p> <p>He hopes to pass on what he's learned to the generation after him, so <a href=\\\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/alaska\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Alaska's fishing industry</a> can live on.</p> <p>\\\"I want them to see a future in it,\\\" he said. \\\"Not just a dead end job.\\\"</p>\"\n",

The indictment also charges Menendez\\u2019s wife, Nadine, and the three businessmen in the years-long bribery scheme. Federal prosecutors said the bribes included gold bars, cash and a luxury convertible.</p> <p>So far, Menendez has refused to resign his seat but stepped down from his position as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Friday.</p> <p>The Democrat senator was also indicted on federal bribery charges in 2016; Booker defended his innocence at the time. That case related to a wealthy Florida eye doctor and longtime friend who gave generous donations to Menendez and allegedly received benefits in return. Menendez was acquitted of the charges in 2018 following a mistrial. The new charges are unrelated.</p> <p>Menendez insisted at a press conference Monday that he will be exonerated, as he detailed his decades-long record in Congress and insisted hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash the FBI found at his home was withdrawn from his personal savings account.\\u00a0</p> <p><a href=\\\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/chris-christie-responds-whether-hed-run-sen-bob-menendezs-seat-2024-democrats-indictment\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><strong><u>CHRIS CHRISTIE RESPONDS ON WHETHER HE'D RUN FOR SEN.

My advocacy has always been grounded. And what I learned from growing up as the son of Cuban refugees, especially my mom, my hero, Evangelina Menendez, everything I accomplished, I worked for despite the naysayers and everyone who has underestimated me.\\\"</p> <p>In June 2022, the FBI executed a search warrant at Menendez and his wife's New Jersey home where federal agents found many of the fruits of the alleged bribery scheme, including cash, gold, the luxury convertible and home furnishings. Prosecutors say $480,000 in cash, much of it stuffed into envelopes and hidden in clothing, closets, and a safe, was discovered in the home, as well as over $70,000 in cash in Nadine's safe deposit box. Some of the envelopes contained the fingerprints and/or DNA of Daibes or his driver, according to the indictment.</p> <p>Other envelopes were found inside jackets bearing Menendez's name and hanging in his closet.</p> <p>New Jersey Congressman Andy Kim, Mikie Sherrill, Bill Pascrell and Frank Pallone have each issued statements calling on Menendez <a href=\\\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">to resign</a>, as well as progressive Rep.

Those players were found guilty of tax evasion but avoided prison time thanks to a provision that allows a judge to waive sentences under two years in length for first-time offenders.</p> <p><a href=\\\"https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p> <p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p>\"\n",

Superintendent Rolland Abraham said.</p> <p>Randolph Central is one of the school corporations that approved plans this month to create armed response teams in five district school buildings. The move to train school staff on deadly force and active shooter training will have at least some of its cost covered by taxpayer dollars, a decision made by state lawmakers earlier this year.</p> <p>Abraham said the training is necessary to \\\"secure lives,\\\" noting that staff and students often \\\"with seconds\\\" in dangerous school scenarios.</p> <p><a href=\\\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-leaders-push-protect-gun-owners-prevent-biden-declaring-health-emergency-gun-violence\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><strong>GOP LEADERS PUSH TO PROTECT GUN OWNERS AND PREVENT BIDEN FROM DECLARING HEALTH EMERGENCY OVER GUN VIOLENCE</strong></a></p> <p>According to gun violence prevention organization Giffords Law Center, at least 28 states allow teachers to carry firearms in K-12 schools. However, in most states, teachers need permission from the district.</p> <p>Indiana's lawmakers gave districts the authority to allow <a href=\\\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/indiana-republicans-inch-closer-state-funded-firearms-training-teachers\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">teachers to carry firearms</a> following the deadly 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting that killed 26 Connecticut residents, 20 of whom were kids.</p> <p>In the time that has passed, at least four Indiana school corporations have already allowed teachers to carry or access firearms. The corporations stated a lack of police resources in schools helped to facilitate the decision.</p> <p>These response training programs were expanded earlier this year when Gov. Eric Holcomb signed a state-funded firearm training for schools' staff into law. <a href=\\\"https://www.indystar.com/story/news/investigations/2023/09/26/teacher-gun-training-indiana-biometric-safes-indiana-general-assembly-hb-1177/70908107007/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">According to Indy Star,</a> the state gave out $101, 979 for the training.</p> <p><a href=\\\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/school-districts-across-america-consider-arming-teachers-aftermath-nashville-school-shooting\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><strong>SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS AMERICA CONSIDER ARMING TEACHERS IN AFTERMATH OF NASHVILLE SCHOOL SHOOTING</strong></a></p> <p>In early September, Randolph Central's school board unanimously adopted a plan where teachers and staff may volunteer to join an \\\"armed response team\\\" to afford them access to loaded handguns. These handguns are to be stored in biometric safes hidden strategically throughout the school buildings.</p> <p>The identity of staff members enrolled in the plan will be kept secret from parents and students.</p> <p>\\\"Team members are explicitly authorized to <a href=\\\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/texas-school-increase-police-arm-teachers\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">use deadly force</a> to protect students, staff members, or others from what is reasonably believed to be an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury due to violence,\\\" the policy states.</p> <p>It is unclear what other schools have received the grants and have chosen to adopt similar plans. According to the Indiana Department of Homeland Security, state law gives public agencies the right to keep school firearm training programs and other security measures confidential.</p> <p><a href=\\\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/federal-judge-strikes-down-california-ban-certain-gun-magazines\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><strong>FEDERAL JUDGE STRIKES DOWN CALIFORNIA BAN OF CERTAIN GUN MAGAZINES</strong></a></p> <p>The grant recipients must finish at least 40 hours of training, including instruction on tactical movement while armed and gun drills for firing in high-stress environments.</p> <p>In Randolph Central, members of the armed response team must also score 90% or above in handgun accuracy. Police officers in the state are required to achieve 80%.</p> <p>Abraham defended the policy by citing <a href=\\\"https://www.secretservice.gov/sites/default/files/2020-04/Protecting_Americas_Schools.pdf\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">a U.S. Secret Service report</a> that analyzed 41 targeted school attacks. The report found that not a single attack was ended by law enforcement responding to the scene from off campus. Meanwhile, 22% of the attacks were ended by school staff.</p> <p>\\\"Most of the time the event is over before law enforcement is able to get there,\\\" Abraham added. \\\"So that's kind of a critical security gap. And we just want to make sure that we have a line of defense between our students and our staff, and any one that would want to do them harm.\\\"</p> <p><i><strong>For more Culture, Media, Education, Opinion, and channel coverage, visit </strong></i><a href=\\\"http://foxnews.com/media\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><i><strong><u>foxnews.com/media</u></strong></i></a><i><strong><u>.</u></strong></i></p>\"\n",
