      "The latest spat was sparked by a 300-metre floating barrier that was found across the entrance of the shoal last week\n",
      "China warns Philippines not to 'stir up trouble' over disputed reef. Latest spat was sparked by a 300-metre floating barrier that was found across the entrance of the shoal last week. Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea has long been a source of tension between the countries. China seized the ring of reefs from the Philippines in 2012 and has since deployed patrol boats. Under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which China helped negotiate, countries have jurisdiction over the natural resources within about 200 nautical miles (370 kilometres) of their shore. The Philippines condemned the installation and its coast guard announced on Monday that it had \"successfully\" removed the barrier from the reef, which Manila calls Bajo de Masinloc. The Philippine Coast Guard specified on Tuesday they had cut a rope tethering the buoys to an anchor on the seabed, and hauled away the anchor, which allowed the line to drift. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin hit back on Tuesday, saying Beijing \"firmly upholds the sovereignty and maritime rights and interests of the Huangyan island\", referring to the Shoal by its Chinese name. ‘Well within rights’, Philippine National Security Adviser Eduardo Ano said his country was \"well within its rights\" \n",
      "Philippines, China trade barbs amid floating barrier row\n",
      "The Philippines has asserted its determination not to yield to Chinese attempts to obstruct its fishermen from accessing a highly disputed shoal in the South China Sea. In response, Beijing issued a warning to the Southeast Asian nation, cautioning against actions that could \"provoke and cause trouble.\"\n",
      "The Philippines has asserted its determination not to yield to Chinese attempts to obstruct its fishermen from accessing a highly disputed shoal in the South China Sea. Beijing issued a warning to the Southeast Asian nation, cautioning against actions that could \"provoke and cause trouble\" The comments came a day after Manila cut a floating 300-m barrier installed by Beijing at the shoal, one of Asia’s most contested maritime features.“They might still return the barrier, they might still do shadowing and dangerous maneouvres,” the Philippine coastguard said. The Philippines vowed on Tuesday not to back down in the face of a Chinese effort to block its fishermenfrom a fiercely contested shoal. The comments come a day After Manila cut the floating 300m barrier at the Shoal, making use of coastguard personnel posing as fishermen in a boat, the Philippines vowed to continue to fight the Chinese efforts to block the access to the area. The incident has sparked a diplomatic row between the two countries. \n",
      "Philippines vows to remove floating barrier placed by China's coast guard at a disputed lagoon\n",
      "Philippine officials have vowed to remove a floating barrier placed by China’s coast guard to prevent Filipino fishing boats from entering a disputed lagoon in the South China Sea\n",
      "Philippine officials have vowed to remove a floating barrier placed by China’s coast guard to prevent Filipino fishing boats from entering a disputed lagoon. They said the 300 metre-long barrier at the entrance to the lagoon at Scarborough Shoal is “illegal and illegitimate” Chinese coast guard vessels laid the barrier, held up by buoys, on Friday as a Philippine government fisheries vessel approached. More than 50 Philippine fishing boats were outside the shoal at the time, the Philippine coast guard said. “The placement by the People's Republic of China of a barrier violates the traditional fishing rights of our fishermen,” Philippine National Security Adviser Eduardo Ano said. The Philippines “will take all appropriate actions to cause the removal of the barriers” China has installed a barrier to block access to Scarborough Shoal. The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan are involved with China in the conflicts. Washington lays no claim to the sea passageway, a major global trade route, but U.S. Navy ships and fighter jets have carried out patrols for decades to challenge China’s expansive claims and promote freedom of navigation and overflight. Beijing refused to participate in the arbitration sought by the Philippines in 2013, a year after a tense standoff between Chinese and Philippine ships at Scarborough. The 2012 standoff ended with Chinese ships seizing and surrounding the atoll. Chinese coast guard ships have also blocked Philippine government vessels delivering supplies and personnel to Philippine-occupied Second Thomas Shoal, resulting in near-collisions.\n",

      "        President Macron says France will end its military presence in Niger and pull ambassador after coup\n",
      "Tensions between France and Niger, a former French colony, have mounted in recent weeks\n",
      "President Emmanuel Macron says France will end its military presence in Niger and pull ambassador after coup. France has maintained some 1,500 troops in Niger since the July coup, and had repeatedly refused an order by the new junta for its ambassador to leave. The announcement is a significant, if predicted, blow to France's policy in Africa, after French troops pulled out of neighboring Mali and Burkina Faso in recent years after coups there. France had stationed thousands of troops in the region at the request of African leaders to fight jihadist groups to fight the insurgency in the West African nation. The junta in August gave French Ambassador Sylvain Itte 48 hours to leave, but after the deadline expired without France recalling him, the coup leaders then revoked his diplomatic immunity. In New York on Friday, the military government that seized power in Niger accused U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres of “obstructing” the nation’s full participation at the U.S.-led summit of world leaders in order to appease France and its allies. In an interview with France-2 television, Mr. Macron said that he spoke Sunday to ousted President Mohamed Bazoum, and told him that “France has decided to bring back its ambassador.” \n",
      "Niger regime wants ‘negotiated framework’ for French army pullout\n",
      "The new military regime said in a statement read out on national TV late on Monday that the timeframe for the pullout “must be set out in a negotiated framework and by mutual agreement”\n",
      "Niger’s coup leaders are demanding a “negotiated framework” for former colonial ruler France to withdraw its troops. Tens of thousands of people have joined demonstrations and gatherings in the Niger capital Niamey in recent weeks calling for the withdrawal of French troops from the country. On Sunday, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that Paris would withdraw its ambassador from Niger, followed by the French military contingent in the coming months. France keeps about 1,500 soldiers in its former West African colony as part of an anti-jihadist deployment in the Sahel., Macron said military cooperation was “over” and French troops would withdraw in “the months and weeks to come” with a full pullout “by the end of the year” Niger’s post-coup authorities “no longer wanted to fight against terrorism’ France has not recognised the authority of the military leaders. Niger is battling two jihadist insurgencies -- a spillover in its southeast from a long-running conflict in neighbouring Nigeria. Tens of thousands of people have joined demonstrations and gatherings in the Niger capital Niamey in recent weeks calling for the withdrawal of French troops from the country. The United States, which has some 1,100 military personnel in Niger, has said it will “evaluate” its future steps on the crisis following France’‘Historic moment, which speaks to the determination and will of the Nigerien people,’ military rulers said in a statement.\n",

      "Imran Khan, the former prime minister of Pakistan, has been shifted to the Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi from the Attock prison. This move comes after the Islamabad High Court ordered his relocation to the high-security jail. Khan, who has been in detention since August, was escorted to the Adiala Jail in an 18-vehicle convoy. The jail superintendent confirmed his arrival and stated that he would be provided with facilities according to the jail manual. The next hearing in Khan's case is scheduled for October 10.\n",
      "Imran Khan has been shifted to the Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi from Attock prison. The move comes after the Islamabad High Court ordered his relocation to the high-security jail. An 18-vehicle convoy, including 15 vehicles of Islamabad police, two armoured vehicles and an ambulance, escorted Khan to the jail. The next hearing in Khan's case is scheduled for October 10. The former prime minister has been detained since August 5 after his arrest following conviction in the Toshakhana case. He was remanded for another 14-days to jail in the cipher case and the next hearing would be held on October 10, according to the court's order. The shifting followed the confusion on Monday when Naeem Panjhota, who is Khan's spokesperson on legal affairs, claimed that the ousted premier had been shifted. But later it proved wrong and he was still being held in the Attock jail during the day where hearing of his cipher case was held. The jail superintendent confirmed Khan's arrival and said he would be provided with facilities according to jail manual. \n",
      "Remand of Imran, Qureshi extended by another 14 days in Cipher case\n",
      "Pakistan's former PM Imran Khan and his close aide Shah Mahmood Qureshi will continue to remain in jail till October 10 as a special court on Tuesday extended for the third time their judicial remand in a case related to the alleged disclosure of state secrets.\n",
      "Remand of Imran, Qureshi extended by another 14 days in Cipher case. Khan was arrested last month after a case was filed against him for allegedly violating the Official Secrets Act by disclosing a secret diplomatic cable. Judge Abul Hasnat Zulqarnain conducted the proceedings inside the high security Attock Jail where the former PM has been detained since August 5.Qureshi was presented before the special court at the Federal Judicial Complex in Islamabad. The case relates to the alleged disclosure of state secrets in March last year in Washington, Pakistan's embassy in the U.S. said in a letter to the State Department. The letter was part of a diplomatic cable sent by Pakistan's Embassy in Washington to the United States in March 2013, according to the letter. The State Department said in the letter that the cable was a ‘cipher’ and that it was intended to be used as a “back-up’ for other diplomatic cables sent to Washington. Pakistan’s embassy in Washington said it had no immediate comment on the letter, which it said was sent by the Pakistani Embassy.\n",

      "China has rejected several proposals from Pakistan regarding direct investments in various sectors under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) The proposals included areas such as energy, tourism, water management, and climate change. The minutes of the CPEC's Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC) meeting reveal the challenges faced by both sides in deepening economic ties. China disagreed with a host of measures Pakistan proposed. Pakistan had proposed Chinese participation in a strategic underground gas storage project but it was not included in the final minutes. Other Islamabad plans that did not make the grade with Beijing included a proposal to develop a policy framework for coal gasification for fertiliser projects based on coal in the southern Sindh province’s Thar desert. Similarly, China did not agree to meet Pakistan’S energy needs from indigenous resources and conversion of coal into other products for domestic demand as well as exports, according to the minutes of a key panel meeting in October 2022. The delay underscores the chasm. The draft shared with Beijing by Pakistan and final minutes signed byboth sides were different in many ways. The final document indicates that Islamabad has given up its opposition to a number of Chinese demands in order to address Beijing's concerns, the minutes said. The signed minutes of CPEC’ JCC bring to fore the formidable challenges both sides face in deepeningEconomic ties. \n",

China excluded cooperation in the areas of cross-border tourism in Gilgit-Baltistan, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, PoK and cooperation for the promotion of coastal tourism. China also did not agree to Pakistan’s proposal for the inclusion of Water Resources Management and Climate Change and Urban Infrastructure Development in the CPEC framework. China excluded the issue of financial challenges being faced by the power companies from the final minutes. Islamabad wanted the conversion of the imported fuel-based Gwadar plant to Thar coal to address energy security and liquidity issues. Pakistan also committed that it would follow the consensus reached by two sides, and will direct the Pakistani power purchase companies to stop deducting the capacity power rate and return the deducted power rate.\n",

      "Nepal says ‘no’ to China’s Global Security Initiative, but takes forward border rail plan as Prachanda visits Beijing. A lengthy joint statement released by the two sides outlined a number of border infrastructure projects, but failed to mention the GSI. “The Nepali side supports the Global Development Initiative (GDI) proposed by China, and will consider to join the Group of Friends of the GDI,” the statement said. Nepal did reaffirm its commitment to China on Tibet and said “it will never allow any separatist activities against China on Nepal’S soil” China, for its part, said it “firmly supports Nepal in upholding its independence’. Nepal refrained from endorsing the GSI in the statement, it did appear to agree to some elements of the kind of security cooperation envisaged by the initiative. The joint statement outlined the breadth and depth of connectivity projects that Nepal and China are working on, including the flagship cross-border railway from Lhasa to Kathmandu. They “agreed to strengthen connectivity in such areas as ports, roads, railways, airways and grids in an orderly manner” and “jointly build the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network”, as the plan is called. During the visit, Nepal also announced it would provide China with a pair of unicorn rhinos, evoking Beijing’s “panda diplomacy”. \n",

The joint statement issued after Prachanda's talks with Xi and Chinese Premier Li Qiang only mentioned their support for the Global Development Initiative proposed by China. The Global Security Initiative and Global Cultural Initiative were conspicuously absent from the joint statement. The two sides agreed to undertake joint inspection of the China-nepal boundary. The Nepal PM had earlier met Xi on the sidelines of the Asian Games in Hangzhou on September 23. The GSI, which also advocates joint security, is not in the interest of Nepal to maintain a strategic balance between India, China and the US, reports from Kathmandu said. The prime minister had categorically denied the chances of Nepal joining a security-related alliance. China views Taiwan as a rebel province that must be reunified with the mainland, even by force. China wants to weigh in to reduce Nepal's dependence on India as part of efforts to expand its own influence. The two sides agreed to continue consultations on the protocol between the Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China and Ministry of Home Affairs of Nepal. They also reiterated their commitment to respecting and accommodating each other's concerns and core interests, the joint statement said. The joint statement also highlighted the number of infrastructure projects connecting Nepal and China through Tibet. This includes the cross-border railway from Lhasa to Kathmandu for which China has undertaken a feasibility study. In his talks with Prachanda, Xi called for China to boost border infrastructure to end Nepal's land-locked status, meaning dependence on Indian.\n",

      "        What will ‘cosmic detective’ OSIRIS-REx bring back on September 24? | Explained\n",
      "Many scientists believe that carbon-rich asteroids like Bennu may have seeded the earth with primordial life.\n",
      "NASA’s asteroid hunting spacecraft OSIRIS-REx will drop a capsule containing pristine asteroid material in the Utah desert on September 24. Many scientists believe that carbon-rich asteroids like Bennu may have seeded the earth with primordial life as they smashed into the young planet more than four billion years ago. “Asteroids are like cosmic treasure troves, containing a mix of raw materials like metals, water, and even organic compounds,” Dr. Dante Lauretta, the principal investigator of the mission, told this writer in an email. The astro-material brought back may provide scientists with valuable insights into how planets formed, what materials were present in the early Solar System, and how life on the earth might have originated.  OSIRIS-REx is bringing material to the earth to help scientists peer back in time, to the violent birth of the Solar System. The asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter is inhabited by thousands of space rocks, ranging in size from that of Ceres – the largest, with a width of more than 800 kilometres – to pint-sized stones. A part of the orbits of some of them bring them within 34 million kilometres of the sun, closer even than Mercury gets. This is what happened in 1937, when Hermes, a giant binary roid, zipped past the earth at less than twice the distance to the moon. Planetary defence experts are keen to know more about such NEAs and how to approach them. But spacefaring countries seem to have sidelined planet security for the mercantile goal of mining asteroids. \n",
      "NASA capsule carrying first asteroid samples lands on Earth\n",
      "Scientists estimate the capsule holds at least a cup of rubble from the carbon-rich asteroid known as Bennu, but won’t know for sure until the container is opened.\n",
      "Scientists estimate the capsule holds at least a cup of rubble from the carbon-rich asteroid known as Bennu, but won’t know for sure until the container is opened. The capsule landed four hours later on a remote expanse of military land, as the mothership set off after another asteroid. The pebbles and dust delivered on September 24 represent the biggest haul from beyond the moon. Preserved building blocks from the dawn of our solar system 4.5 billion years ago, the samples will help scientists better understand how Earth and life formed.

Use #AskNASA to send us your questions. https://t.co/biS33u6RtP, — NASA (@NASA) September 24, 2023, “We have touchdown!” Flight Control announced. The samples will be flown on September 25 morning to a new lab at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. The building already houses the hundreds of kilogrammes of moon rocks gathered by the Apollo astronauts more than a half-century ago. Engineers estimate the canister holds 250g of material from Bennu, plus or minus 100g. Even at the low end, it will easily surpass the minimum requirement of the mission, Dante Lauretta said. Bennu is expected to come dangerously close to Earth in 2182 — possibly close enough to hit. The data gleaned by Osiris-Rex will help with any asteroid-deflection effort, according to Mr. Lauretta., Osiris- Rex is already chasing the asteroid Apophis, and will reach it in 2029.\n",

      "Mr. Biden said the United States had a long history of cooperation with the Cook Islands, dating back to World War II\n",
      "The United States will recognize the independence of the Cook Islands and Niue, two small Pacific nations, President Joe Biden said on September 25. Mr. Biden spoke ahead of a summit with Pacific island leaders this week, part of a U.S. charm offensive to block further Chinese inroads into a strategic region Washington has long considered its own backyard. The White House said the summit will focus on priorities including climate change, economic growth, sustainable development, public health and countering illegal fishing. The United States had a long history of cooperation with the Cook islands, dating back to World War II, when the U.s. military built airport runways on one of the chain's atolls. \"Today's announcement will enable us to expand the scope of this enduring partnership as we seek to tackle the challenges that matter most to our peoples' lives,\" he said. The U.N. Security Council passed a resolution earlier this month to recognize the Cook Island's right to self-determination. The resolution was backed by the United Nations, the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. \n",
      "U.S. will establish diplomatic ties with the Cook Islands and Niue as Biden hosts Pacific leaders\n",
      "President Joe Biden is set to establish diplomatic relations with two South Pacific nations, the Cook Islands and Niue, as his administration aims to show to Pacific Island leaders that's committed to increasing American presence in the region\n",
      "U.S. will establish diplomatic ties with the Cook Islands and Niue as Biden hosts Pacific leaders. Announcement comes as Biden prepares to welcome leaders to Washington for a two-day U.S.-Pacific Island Forum Summit expected to focus heavily on the impact of climate change. Biden has put a premium on improving ties in the Pacific amid rising American concern about China’s growing military and economic influence. Pacific Island leaders have been critical of rich countries for not doing enough to control climate change despite being responsible for much of the problem. The White House unveiled its Pacific strategy, an outline of its plan to assist the region’S leaders on pressing issues like climate change, maritime security and protecting the region from overfish last year. The administration pledged the U.S. would add $810 million in new aid for Pacific Island nations over the next decade, including $130 million on efforts to stymie the impacts of climate change. The forum includes Australia, the Cook Islands, Micronesia, Fiji, French Polynesia, Kiribati, Nauru, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Republic of Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. The White House said most members of the 18-member forum were dispatching their top elected official or foreign minister to the summit. But the administration was ‘very disappointed’ that Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare, who was in New York last week for U.N. General Assembly.\n",
